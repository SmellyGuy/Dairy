Dependency injection:
    Three methods to realize the dependency injection:
    1.use the setter property method to realize it ;
    2.use the construction function to realize it ;
    3.use the factory method to realize it;
    
    now let me talk about it in details:
    First is the property-method:
       it injects the object and its attributes via the setter() function ;so it will call its default construct method to realize it 
       and  to use the set method to inject the propertie to the attributes by the reflection mechanism;The property method should have a default construct method 
       and procide the set() method to inject the attributes values;
       
       public class Car{
         private String carname;
         private String brand;
         
         public void setBrand(String brand){
         this.brand=brand;
         }
         public String getBrand(){
         return this.brand;
         }
       }
    xml:
    <bean id="car" class="com.mrlee.bean.Car">
       <property name="brand">
       <value>Benci</>
       </property>
       <propety name="carname">
        <value>GLV/5</value>
       </property>
    </bean>
    
    Second id the construct method to realize it :
      
         it makes suer that the main propertie will be instantiated with the initiation values;
         and it can be used after that directly;so it must contain the default construct method with the args;
         and it will various from the introduce by the type to index and by the reflection mechanism;
         
         
         public class Car{
           public Car(String brand ,String carname){
           this.brand=carname;
           this.brand=brand;
           }
           public String getBrandName(){
           return brand;
           }
           public void setBrandName(){
           this.brand=brand;
           }
         }
         
         xml:
         <bean id="Car" class="com.mrlee.Car">
          <construcor-arg type="String">
            <value>benci</value>
          </constructor-arg>
         </bean>
